## **Reactive Programming vs Traditional (Imperative) Programming in Spring Boot**

| Feature | **Reactive (WebFlux, Project Reactor)** | **Traditional (Spring MVC, Blocking)** |
|---------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Thread Model** | Uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O with a small number of threads (Netty by default). | Uses a thread-per-request model (Tomcat/Jetty). |
| **Concurrency Handling** | Scales well with reactive streams (`Flux`, `Mono`), allowing better CPU and resource utilization. | Creates a new thread for each request, which may cause performance issues under heavy load. |
| **Response Handling** | Uses `Mono<T>` (single item) and `Flux<T>` (multiple items) for asynchronous processing. | Uses `ResponseEntity<T>` or plain objects (`T`), returning fully resolved responses. |
| **Database Access** | Uses **R2DBC** (Reactive Relational DB Connectivity) or NoSQL databases like MongoDB. | Uses **JDBC**, which is blocking and requires a connection per request. |
| **Performance & Scalability** | High performance for I/O-intensive apps (e.g., real-time data streaming, chat apps). | Works well for CPU-bound tasks but struggles with high concurrency. |
| **Error Handling** | Uses `.onErrorResume()`, `.onErrorReturn()`, and `.doOnError()` for reactive error handling. | Uses `try-catch` and `@ExceptionHandler` for handling errors. |
| **Streaming Data** | Supports live data streaming via `Flux<T>`, **WebSockets**, and **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. | Does not natively support streaming responses without additional configurations. |
| **Backpressure Handling** | Supports built-in **backpressure** (handling excessive data flow). | No built-in backpressure; relies on buffering or custom mechanisms. |
| **Code Complexity** | Requires a different mindset with `Mono`, `Flux`, and functional programming. | Easier to understand for developers familiar with synchronous programming. |
| **Use Cases** | Ideal for **real-time applications, microservices, event-driven systems, and IoT**. | Best suited for **CRUD applications, monolithic apps, and synchronous workflows**. |

### **Which One Should You Choose?**
- Use **Reactive WebFlux** for:
    - High-performance, non-blocking APIs
    - Streaming data & real-time applications
    - Large-scale microservices needing scalability
- Use **Traditional Spring MVC** for:
    - Simple CRUD applications
    - Low concurrency workloads
    - Standard REST APIs with blocking dependencies
